 showcases the design and working of a robotic jaw gripper mechanism. Created with precision using CAD software, the mechanism simulates how a robotic gripper securely holds and manipulates objects. The design includes a clever arrangement of linkages and actuation, mimicking the functionality of a jaw.

Ideal for robotics enthusiasts, engineering students, and those exploring automation, this project highlights the principles of gripping mechanisms and their applications in robotics and industrial automation.
